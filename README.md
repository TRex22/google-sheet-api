# google-sheet-api
A pure Ruby Google Sheet API for reading and writing to Google Sheets. Uses Google Forms for submitting data.
This is an unofficial project!

The aim is to create a client that uses pure Ruby to interact with a Google Sheet.

To read from the Google sheet it needs to be public.
To write to the Google sheet, you need to create a public Google form which submits to a Google sheet.

This is highly experimental and not really intended for production

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'google-sheet-api'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install google-sheet-api

## Usage

```ruby
  require 'google-sheet-api'
  client  = GoogleSheetApi::Client.new
```

### Endpoints
- `client.get_sheet_data(sheet_url, type: 'csv')`
- `client.get_form(form_url)`
- `client.get_form_inputs(form_url)`
- `client.get_post_form_url(form_url)`
- `client.submit_form(form_url, form_post_url, payload_object:)`
Make sure that the payload_object is a hash where the keys match the exact (human readable) names of the inputs as named on the form
